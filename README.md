# Game State Management

This JavaScript project is designed for managing player states. It features a `Player` class and multiple `State` subclasses to handle various player actions like standing, sitting, running, jumping, and falling.

## Features

-   **Dynamic State Management:** Each character state (e.g., `StandingRight`, `JumpingLeft`) is a class that defines specific behaviors and handles user inputs differently.
-   **Animation Handling:** Character's animation and movement logic are efficiently handled within each state's `enter` and `update` methods.
